# Setup
I'm running the `future` branch of the lci interpreter.

Since there's not actually any imports, I have to put all the code for each day into the same file. This produces really long files which are hard to navigate. So super thanks to the Bookmarks extension in VSCode - it's made things slightly easier.

The input files use the LF End of Line sequence.
- TREATZ is the set of examples
- NOMNOMZ is the set of full size inputs
